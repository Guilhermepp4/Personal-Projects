# File Editor

#### This project was created for the company Tabique (https://www.tabique.pt). The goal of the project was to simplify the editing of company files that required only minor changes, especially when the replacement text was the same in multiple files.

#### This project was my first experience working with HTML and CSS. During the project, I learned how to connect Python with HTML.
